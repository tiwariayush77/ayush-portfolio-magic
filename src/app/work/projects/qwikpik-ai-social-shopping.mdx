# QwikPik: AI-Powered Social Shopping Assistant

QwikPik helps shoppers beat choice paralysis by pairing AI recommendations with community validation so decisions are faster, confident, and social.

## Problem
Online shoppers face overwhelming choice, noisy reviews, and low confidence before purchase.

## Solution
- AI recommendation engine that learns preferences and context
- Social validation layer (community ratings, real-use photos, trusted lists)
- Visual search, real-time price checks, and shareable shortlists

## Technical Implementation
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- AI: Google Gemini for NLP and product matching
- Data: Firebase for real-time sync; third‑party commerce APIs for catalog and prices

## Impact
- 40% higher discovery time-on-task (engagement)
- 25% improvement in decision confidence (survey)
- 60% utilization of social validation features
